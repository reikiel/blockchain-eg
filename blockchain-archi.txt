Block (block.js)
- index: GensisBlock is the first block, with index value 0
- txns: Raw transactions in the block. Doesn't have to be crypto but any type of data you want to store
- blockHeader

BlockHeader
- version: Version 1 is the genesis block
- previousBlockHeader: SHA-256 hash function of the previous block's header. Ensures that the previous block cannot be changed as this block needs to be changed as well
- merkleRoot: A merkle tree is a binary tree that holds all the hashed pairs of the tree
- time: Unix epoch time when the miner started hashing the header
* nonce: In a bitcoin block, it is a 32-bit field whose value is adjusted so that the hash of the block will be less than or equal to the current target of the network
* nBits: Refers to the target, which is a 256-bit number and inversely proportional to the difficulty. Recalculated every 2,016 blocks
