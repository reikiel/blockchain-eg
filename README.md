\*\* To add brief intro of the code and how to run

Future improvements:

- Confirmations: Each miner sends a message with a block. You can create a confirmation system to ensure the integrity of the data
- TRansactions/data: Implement transactions or data objects to address double spending, transaction validation, and coinbase transactions
- levelDB: Once the P2p is initialized, create a script to retrieve and write all the blocks into the LDB, validate them, and clean the db as needed
